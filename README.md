- **Family life**: These are the tasks related to family life, exchanges, sharing, going out, activities, common values, even even the in-laws and the larger family.
- **Social life**: these are all activities related to relationships with others, friends, acquaintances, new meetings, but above all the frequency, quantity, quality, sincerity and authenticity of these relationships
- **Professional life**: these are activities linked to the trade, profession, career, salary, skills, organization, planning, but also professional relations, recognition, career changes and to ambition.

I am Mathieu CAROFF. I grow up with my family, school and some friends. I encounter specialists. Specialist A makes me read a book. I mature in contact with science, English, German, intense mathematics, internet, search of quality of knowledge, Spanish and computer programming, open source. I return to person A. I finish my studies. I meet the book of Rosenberg. I meet the Toki Pona language. I meet person B, more gentle, a sophrologist. I meet the monkey person. I decide to know my relationship to the world. I learn the languages.

The elements that I wish to share with the world in my story are:

- family
- friends
- science
- mathematic, axiomatique theory, programming/IT, **langages**
- quality research
- programming, graph theory, open-source, transparency, attribution
- **Rosenberg's book**
- sophrology, body
- **language of simplicity: Toki Pona**
- relation, connexion
- understanding of my relation to the world, of my skin

I mature in contact with science, English, German, intense mathematics, internet, search of quality of knowledge, Spanish and computer programming, open source. I return to person A. I finish my studies. I meet the book of Rosenberg. I meet the Toki Pona language. I meet person B, more gentle, a sophrologist. I meet the monkey person. I decide to know my relationship to the world. I learn the languages.
